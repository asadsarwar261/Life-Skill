# Grit and growth Mindset

## 1. Grit
Grit means having a strong passion and determination to achieve long-term goals. It involves consistently working hard and staying committed to your future, not just for a short time, but over many years, like running a marathon instead of a sprint.  

## 2. Growth Mindset
A growth mindset means believing you can improve and learn new things with effort and practice, while a fixed mindset is thinking your abilities are set in stone. Embracing a growth mindset helps you keep learning and stay positive, even when facing challenges.  

## 3. Internal Locus of Control
**Internal Locus of Control:** It means believing you can influence your life outcomes through your actions and choices. If you have this mindset, you think your efforts impact your success and failures.
