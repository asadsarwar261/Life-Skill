# Grit and growth Mindset

## 1. Grit
Grit means having a strong passion and determination to achieve long-term goals. It involves consistently working hard and staying committed to your future, not just for a short time, but over many years, like running a marathon instead of a sprint.

## 2. Growth Mindset
A growth mindset means believing you can improve and learn new things with effort and practice, while a fixed mindset is thinking your abilities are set in stone. Embracing a growth mindset helps you keep learning and stay positive, even when facing challenges.
