# Tiny Habits  

## Q1: Most interesting story or idea as per video?  

Behaviour can change and it's not complicated it's just systematic.

To achieve goals, you need to focus on the small step, not the goal itself. Small steps are clearly defined actions.  

## Q2: How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P?  

B for Behaviour
M for Motivation
A for Ability
P for Prompt

Behavior: Reading one page of a book.
Motivation: I enjoy reading, but sometimes I feel too tired or busy.
Ability: Starting with reading just one page.
Prompt: Daily at right reading one page just before going to bed.  

## Q3: Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?  

Because it reinforces the behaviour to repeat and helps in making it more automatic over the time.

It brings a good emotion of accomplishment and this feeling becomes dopamine for repeating that task.
