# Tiny Habits  

## Q1: Most interesting story or idea as per video?  

Behaviour can change and it's not complicated it's just systematic.

To achieve goals, you need to focus on the small step, not the goal itself. Small steps are clearly defined actions.  

## Q2: How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P?  

B for Behaviour<br>
M for Motivation<br>
A for Ability<br>
P for Prompt<br>

Behavior: Reading one page of a book.<br>
Motivation: I enjoy reading, but sometimes I feel too tired or busy.<br>
Ability: Starting with reading just one page.<br>
Prompt: Daily at right reading one page just before going to bed.<br>

## Q3: Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of a habit?  

Because it reinforces the behaviour to repeat and helps in making it more automatic over the time.

It brings a good emotion of accomplishment and this feeling becomes dopamine for repeating that task.

## Q4: what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

To execute a habit first shrink a habit to the most tiny version and easy behaviour that can be completed in 30 seconds or less then use an action promptly to trigger the tiny habit, to start the habit with momentum and after completing the habit always celebrate the completion of habit, the more you celebrate the faster the habit will grow.  

## Q5: What is the book's perspective about Identity?

As per book the most effective way to change your habits is to focus on who you want to become, not just what you want to achieve.  

## Q6: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

To make a habit easier to do, the book suggests using strategies that reduce friction and increase convenience.  

**Reduce Friction:** Minimize the steps required to perform the habit.<br>

**The Two-Minute Rule:** The book advises starting with a version of the habit that takes two minutes or less.<br>

**Prime the Environment:** Optimize your environment to make the desired habit the default action.<br>  

## Q7: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?  

To make a habit harder to do, the book suggests strategies that increase friction and reduce convenience.  

The extra steps create a barrier that makes it less likely for you to engage in the habit impulsively.  

**Inversion of the Two-Minute Rule:** Just as the two-minute rule is used to start a good habit, it can be used to make bad habits harder.   Adding time in the involvement of bad habbit can discourage you from indulging.<br>

**Designing Your Environment:** Make undesirable habits more difficult by altering environment.<br>  

## Q8: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

To make reading every night a natural part of my routine, I’ll set the stage by placing a book on my pillow before I leave the room each morning.
When I come to bed, the book is the first thing I see, ready and waiting. I’ll start with just one page keeping it simple then give myself a little fist pump after finishing.
This tiny celebration will make the habit something I look forward to each night.


## Q9: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

To break the habit of scrolling on my phone at night, I’ll leave it charging in the living room before heading to bed.
Out of sight, out of mind! Instead of mindlessly scrolling, I’ll reach for the book on my pillow.
As the habit of reading grows, the phone will become less and less tempting, making it easier to let go of that nighttime distraction.
